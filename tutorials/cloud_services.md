## 1. _Github_

* Go to https://github.com
* Sign up with *your name* if possible. You will have this ID for a long time. 
* Pick the _developer plan_ -- it's $7.00/month and as a professional tool, it's well worth it. 
* Put in some way to pay the bill. 

## 2. _Python Anywhere_

* Use your kent ID as your username, 
* Click on _Pricing & Signup_ in the top row.

* Enter some way to pay the bill.
* Also, go ahead and sign up for a second free plan using _yourusername_api_ as the username. You will want this eventually. 

## 2. _MLAB_ (was _MongoLabs_)

_MLAB_ is a cloud provider for Mongo databases. You can connect to an MLAB database from anywhere with an internet connection.
